## This is My personal silly project to learn programming. If you find me doing things in a bad way then please reach out and tell me a better way of doing things!

Currently using: 
- Raylib_cs
- ImgUI Net
- Box2dX
- Newtonsoft.json
- Ini Parser

I have made a simple Entity component system for the engine.
