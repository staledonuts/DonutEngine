### This is a 2D GameEngine project to learn programming. If you find me doing things in a bad way or have questions then dont hesitate to reach out! Always fun to connect with people :) 
If if feel like it in the future i might create a 3D module too for it. But main focus is 2D to begin with.

### I will be adding instructions and documentations for using this little project.
